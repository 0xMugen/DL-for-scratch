# Neural Network From Scratch

Welcome to the "Dl for scratch" repository! This project is an educational endeavor to build a simple feedforward neural network using pure Python, without the assistance of any external libraries, including NumPy. The code aims to contain implementations for matrix multiplication, gradient descent, and visualization functions.

## Introduction

Building a neural network from scratch provides valuable insight into the inner workings and mechanics of how neural networks operate. It can be beneficial for both beginners who are trying to understand the core concepts and for experienced individuals aiming to reinforce their foundational knowledge.

## Goals

1. **Matrix Operations**: Core matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition are implemented using vanilla Python.
2. **Feedforward Neural Network**: A simple neural network architecture that can be trained on datasets.
3. **Gradient Descent**: The backpropagation algorithm and gradient descent are utilized for training the neural network.
4. **Visualization**: Functions to visualize the loss over epochs and predictions using Python's basic plotting capabilities.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:0xMugen/DL-for-scratch.git
   ```
